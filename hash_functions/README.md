Interface library providing efficient implementations for various hashing schemas. To use it, simply 

```c++
#include "hashing.hpp"

XXHash::XX3_hash(value);
```

The subfolders contain open source reference implementations for various hashing families/methods and code to test
them (namely, smhasher). Where possible, implementations are added as git submodules.
