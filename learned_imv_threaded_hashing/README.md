# learned_imv_thread_hashing
Exploring the learned models along with interleaved multi-vectorization to improve the performance of hashing. In this project, some code blocks are re-used from db-imv repo (https://github.com/fzhedu/db-imv). Currently, we support 8-bytes tuples (4-bytes key, 4-bytes payload), and BUCKET_SIZE must be 1
